# Software Engineering: The Mindset

Before we think about software development good practices in a technical sense, I believe it's worth thinking about a "higher-order"
good practice, which is approaching it with the right mindset. 

A "contextualizing prompt" for you to embody before you take action üòÖ.

This article is a collection of tips that, in my experience help create thriving software projects.

## 1. Tech debt - pay it, while it's cheap.

You probably have some, right?
Maybe left over from a not-so-distant past when you were sprinting to quickly build an MVP.

But looking forward, to keep growing your software product and keep it healthy, you'll need [good architecture](/good-architecture/), 
good abstractions and **revert the growing tendency** of tech debt. 

This requires making a decision that, from this point onwards, we'll make sure debt only decreases.

A good way to do that is to work on bug üêû fixes! 
Bugs are rarely the result of a single isolated problem. 
Instead, they are usually the result of some deeper related debt around some functionality. 
We should try to work on bugs in way that fixes them quickly first, 
but then do a deeper critical analysis to understand what is the kind of debt that allowed that bug to exist, 
and then work to decrease or maybe even eliminate that debt.

## 2 - Code is a place.
I'm sure you've felt it. 
When you're "in the zone", code is not only a thing that you manipulate. 
It becomes a _space_ that surrounds your conscience, a _place_ around you. 

I saw [this movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219289/) once about a regular guy who found a pill that made him super smart. 
He lives alone in a messy apartment, and the very first thing he does when he's in "super-smart mode" is clean the place: 
do the dishes, put out the dirty clothes lying around, take out the trash‚Ä¶ 
It was like he knew he needed to clean the place in order to think straight. It blew my mind üò≤üò≤, I never forgot that. 
"The first thing you do when you're super smart is to make the space around you clean and organized". This feels exactly right.

## 3 - Chaos and Order
I read once that our brain has two sides because we have evolutionarily adapted to an interesting aspect of reality: 
the world is made of chaos and order, familiar and unfamiliar, explored and unexplored. 
And our conscience is the process that transforms chaos into order. 

It's something like: When you're in the middle of chaos, at first you don't know what to do. 
So you do nothing, you're paralyzed by chaos. 

But you're not doing nothing. You're paying attention. You're learning about this new unfamiliar environment. 
Until you understand just enough to reorganize it a little bit. This is a seed of order. 

As you keep working in that seed, you change the once unfamiliar environment around you for the better, 
you create an expanding domain of order out of chaos.

As a programmer, you sure have lived through this process many times. 
For example at first you may not have a clear idea of how state flows through a particular part of the code. 
Then after studying, testing, debugging, you start to wrap your head around it. 
And then _your brain starts to poke you with ideas_ on how to improve that code somehow.

Programmers should feel discomfort in chaos, but never feel intimidated by it, since you know how to thrive in it. 

You're an agent of order. A bringer of order through attention, learning, and work.
