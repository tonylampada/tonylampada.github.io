### 1. Who am I

I am a Brazilian software engineer and have been programming professionally since 2000. My motto is "solve problems and help people".
So if you're ever in a pinch and need some tech advice or help, feel free to find me on whatsapp and I'll do what I can to help.

I'm easy to work with. I take my job very seriously but I prefer to work in more relaxed and playful environments, and I do what I can to provide that kind of environment to people who work with me.

Last but not least, I'm a husband and father of an awesome couple of boys.

### 2. What I can do

* I can do other things but I have worked most of my life with web development and devops. My favorite stack for webdev is Postgres, AWS, Docker, Python, Django and Vue.js.
* I can put together modern web applications and **scalably** deploy them - in an automated fashion - to production environments in the cloud with **zero downtime**.
* I can organize the development proccess for your team, and apply the right tools to make development a breeze both for front-end and back-end.
* I can design and understand business processes, and I can *help* with project management and bring a set of management best practices that tends to make everyone deliver better results consistently.
* I can (and love to) teach/train people on back-end and front-end development and devops tools and practices and I try my best motivate and influence people to be better programmers.

### 3. What I can't do

* Be a full time project manager. I love the **building part** too much for that.
* Write good, working CSS code  - a frustration that I hope I'll overcome some day. Right now I usually need a CSS-ninja to work with me.

### 4. What do I like

I believe software is **a form of art** and I care a lot for the **inner quality** of the software I build. Things like unit testing, good architecture, well-designed APIs matter a lot to me.

I'm passionate about open source, and education in technology.

### 5. Things I did that you can see online

* [Evolutio](https://evolutio.io) - A website with free educational content for anyone who wants to learn to code.
* [Djangular3](https://github.com/tonylampada/djangular3) - A reusable web-project template using Django and AngularJS (README is in portuguese, but there's a [setup instructions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okWBei-rK_A&feature=youtu.be) in english as well)
* [Djavue](https://github.com/tonylampada/djavue2) - Same as above, but with Django and Vue.js (pun intended :P). This served as the foundation on top of which [Buser](https://www.buser.com.br) technology was built. The corresponding [Djavue course on evolutio](https://evolutio.io/curso/djavue) has been used for training developers ever since. 
* [tlvuestarter](https://github.com/tonylampada/tlvuestarter) - A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) starter template, featuring [mock-apis](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/javascript-mock-api-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-232b3ba46b12#.x73b44qmt) and a [component catalog](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/component-catalog-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-72ee1dc1f6b1#.nt4v0zen0).

## -- Traditional stuff

### 6. Education

Computer Engineering, graduated in 2003
[Aeronautics Technological Institute – ITA](http://www.ita.br/)

### 7. Work Experience

#### [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) (Since Mar/2023)

**Fullstack developer**: //TODO

#### [Buser](https://buser.com.br) (Dec/2017 - Mar/2023)
Bus travel mobile app. Helping people travel by half the price or with twice the comfort. Changing the landscape of intercity bus travel in Brazil.

**CTO and Principal Engineer**: I was the first person hired by the founders. My mission was to build the first version of Buser's website to sell tickets online. I used Django, Vue.js, AWS, a continuous delivery pipeline with Gitlab. 100% inside my comfort zone. That part was a piece of cake. But the easy part ends there.
Buser's rapid growth demanded that I quickly learned a new set of skills way far from what my career had prepared me for. Hiring people. Building teams. Training people. Managing people and projects. Negotiating with different stakeholders in an ever more complex environment. Then re-learn to do all that again, but remotely, because of COVID. And all that while building and mantaining a strong engineering culture of **autonomy and responsibility** - encouraging people to act and see themselves as "problem solver first, programmer later". Being Buser's CTO was the wildest ride on my career, and our engineering culture is an accomplishment I take most pride in.

In may/2022 (Buser had ~550 people, ~140 in technology) I [decided to step down as Buser's CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vida-longa-ao-cto-tony-lampada/?trackingId=XcO0rzL%2Fz5apjfn8uB9D9Q%3D%3D) in order to reconnect with my natural vocation and competence. This was only possible because my good friend [Thiago Avelino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avelinorun/) accepted the challenge of being the executive leader that Buser needs at this time. As a principal engineer, my new mission is to help tech teams improve themselves and build great software - which is exactly what I love doing.

#### **Independent consulting** (part time, jan/2017 - dec/2018)
Some consulting here and there, on web development and devops

**Consultant**: I'm helping companies set up their continuous integration / deployment pipeline, improve their infrascture to make them scalable, refactor their development environments to be more efficient, etc. Companies I helped so far: [Jetsoft](http://www.jetsoft.com.br/), [Moneto](https://www.moneto.com.br/), [Quero bolsa](https://querobolsa.com.br/)

#### [STA - Spacetime Analytics](http://spacetimeanalytics.com) (part time, may/2016 - jun/2018)
Machine-learning-based products and services for decision making.

**Chief Architect, Platforms**: STA uses artificial intelligence, geoprocessing and data science to solve hard problems that traditional IT companies cannot.
Like, use historical data for climate and satellite pictures to predict how much sugar cane will be obtained in the next crop.
I did learn a little bit of machine learning, data science and statistics, but my main work here was to build the platforms where complex, computational-intensive alghorithms run, and also provide web-interfaces where clients can get the results they need.

#### [Lance Ótimo](http://lanceotimo.com) (part-time, jun/2015 - dec/2019)
Bid management platform for Google AdWords advertisers

**CTO/Developer**: My friend and associate Rafael was already helping clients with Google Adwords optimization and, at first, using excel spreadsheets was fine.
He anticipated that his business was going to grow and that was when he invited me to help "productizing" his process in the form of a web platform.
I jumped in, he learned Python and reimplemented all of his spreadsheets in python scripts. I put it all together inside a web application that clients can now use to tweak parameters and get reports that provide marketing insights.

Lance Ótimo runs on Python, Django, Postgres, AWS, Celery, and AngularJS.

#### [ng-masters](http://ng-masters.com/) (mai/2014 - oct/2015)
AngularJS online Training Course - a successful weekend project

**Instructor**: During my work using AngularJS in QMágico, I liked it so much that I decided I wanted to teach more people about it and as a result ng-masters was born.
NG-masters was a 16h online course spread across 4 online webinars that happened on saturday or monday mornings. 
A month before each cohort started I would phone everyone that had registered on the website, and tried to understand better their problems, their context, and how (and if) the course would be useful for them. It was an amazing experience.

With ng-masters I had the privilege of touching the lives of ~120 people during 5 cohorts, and I still feel I learned more than I taught.
